Congratulations, your new presentation is now ready
for editing.

You can start up a server that will point to http://localhost:4000

    cd #{init_options.folder}
    bin/rake serve

If you add any node.js components, you can add to the setup.sh
script, it would be a good place to add the "npm install" or
"yarn" command.

I've already performed the initial git commit. You should keep
committing changes as you go along.

The "_publish.yml" file is used to modify the links and the
destination directory for publishing. This is mainly set up
for publishing to github pages using the "docs/" directory on
the master branch. If you want to go this way, the "_publish.yml"
file settings should be something like:

    url: "https://YOURGITHUB.github.io"
    baseurl: "/REPO_NAME"
    destination: docs

In the REPO_NAME settings you can specify the location for
your github pages.

When you want to add slides, you can run "jrg" from the
presentation root and answer the questions.

    cd #{init_options.folder}
    jrg slide
