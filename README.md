# JekyllRevealGenerator

Generate Jekyll-Reveal.js Slide Presentations

## Installation

Install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll_reveal_generator

## Usage

	$ jekyll_reveal_generator help

## Templates

The slide presentation templates are in the `templates/` directory.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install
dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run
`bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to
experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake
install`. To release a new version, update the version number in
`version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will
create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push
the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Testing

We are using `minitest` to drive testing of the generator.
